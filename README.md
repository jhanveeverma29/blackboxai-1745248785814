# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to manage a small library of books. Users can add, remove, issue, and return books. The system also demonstrates exception handling in Java through various examples. 

## Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd library-management-system
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the main application:
   ```
   java Main
   ```

## Usage
Upon running the `Main` class, the application will perform the following actions:
- Add several books to the library.
- List all available books.
- Attempt to issue a book (showing handling for already issued books).
- Return an issued book.
- Remove a book from the library.
- List the books again to show current status.

## Features
- Add books to the library.
- Remove books from the library.
- Issue books to users with basic handling for availability.
- Return issued books to the library.
- Exception handling demonstrations for common programming errors.

## Dependencies
This project does not have external dependencies as it relies on the core Java libraries. Ensure you have Java JDK installed.

## Project Structure
Here is the structure of the project:

```
library-management-system/
│
├── Main.java                     # Entry point of the application
├── ExceptionHandlingDemo.java    # Demonstrates basic exception handling
└── IntermediateExceptionHandlingDemo.java  # Demonstrates advanced exception handling techniques
```

### Explanation of Key Classes:
- **`Main`**: Responsible for orchestrating the library operations and showcasing the library services.
- **`ExceptionHandlingDemo`**: A simple demonstration of exception handling using `try-catch` blocks.
- **`IntermediateExceptionHandlingDemo`**: An advanced demonstration that includes multiple catch blocks, resource management with try-with-resources, and throwing custom exceptions.

Feel free to explore and enhance the application with additional features!
